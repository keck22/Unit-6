# Executive Summary

Today we will learn the importance of interent security, the different types of domains, and how to code in HTML and CSS.

# Internet Architecture

## Internet Protocol

What is an IP address and what is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?
IP or Internet Protocol adresses are the unique numbers assigned to every computer or device connected to the internet. The difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is IPv4 has a much smaller address space than IPv6. 
Find the IP address of your computer by typing ipconfig at the command prompt (refer back to the "Operating Systems" module for details.) Take a screenshot of the command without including the IP address to show your success, name the file ipconfig and upload to the lab folder on GitHub.
What is ICANN and how do they contribute to the global Internet?
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) coordirnating the maintenence and procedures of several databases. This ensures the network's stable and secure operation.
## TCP/IP

### Review the first article and answer these questions:

What is the responsibility of TCP/IP?
TCP/IP a network protocol that defines the details of how data is sent and recieved through network communications.
Explain how the client-server model applies to TCP/IP.
The client-server model connects an IP adress to whatever server the user is trying to connect to. 
### Review the second article and answer these questions:

Review the section of the article aligning the post office with protocol stacks.

Why are layers important to changing technology?
Layers govern on how systems communicate. Layers can communicate above or under to other layers.
What types of applications run on the "application" layer?
HTTP, FTP, POP3, SMTP,SNMP run on the application layer.
# Internet Security

### Watch the video and answer these questions:

What is HTTP and how does it support the client-server model?
HTTP is the protocol used for viewing web pages on the internet. HTTP supports the client-server model by creating a portal to a specific spot on a website. 
Explain the protocols that secure HTTP uses to protect data.
HTTP is transfered into HTTPS that secures your information by encrypting your personally information.
### Review the following article: Securing Your Web Browser

Why should you secure your browser?
Securing your browser is important to reduce the chances of spyware and a random person taking control of your computer
Explain one of the risks described in the article.
One risk described in the article was someone stealing your information off of your computer while you not knowing of it. 
# Internet Programming

Upload screenshots of your html, css and result
Answer these questions

Who was Tim Berners-Lee and why did he create the W3C?
Tim Berners-Lee is the founder of W3C, he created W3C to help coordinate technology developement.

Pick a "standard" of your choice and explain why it is important.

Explain how XML differs from HTML.
XML was designed to carry data while HTML was designed to display data.
# URLs and File Paths

scheme - specific location on a page
domain -  www.amazon.com 
top level domain - https
defult page - result of search
parameters - no file path provided
anchor -  .edu

What is your understanding of difference between Absolute and Relative File Paths. What would you use in your website? Why?
Absolute paths always include the domain name whereas Relative File Paths only point to a file.

Explain the purpose and use of file compression.
Compressing files takes up less space and allows them to be transfered more quickly

# Conclusion

I learned how to code in HTML and CSS,the difference between http and https, and the purpose of internet security.
